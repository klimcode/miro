# Miro EmailEditor
A tiny (under 2KB Gziped) library to handle email lists.

An instance is an inline HTML element (contains only inline elements: span, input, i).
Just mount it to an empty HTML element (min size is 80px x 43px) and it works.
No global space pollution*


*except of the Constructor function which is a downside of the selected module type
